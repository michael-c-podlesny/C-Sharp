   public int Spinner(int min, int max)
        {
            var rnd = new Random();
            return rnd.Next(min,max);
        }
        
        The above code generates a random number from min to max+1
        
        have to add 1 to max in order to include the max number
        
        example, if you want a random number from 1 to 14 ... rnd would generate a number from 1 to 13, so we add 1 to max to make it 15 to make sure we get up to and including 14.



// using random to manipulate strings
            const int passwordLength = 10;
            var random = new Random();
            var buffer = new char[passwordLength];

            for(var i=0;i< passwordLength; i++)
            {
                buffer[i] = (char)('a' + random.Next(0, 26));
            }

            var password = new string(buffer);

                Console.WriteLine(password);
            
        }
