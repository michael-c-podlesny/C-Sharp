   public int Spinner(int min, int max)
        {
            var rnd = new Random();
            return rnd.Next(min,max+1);
        }
        
        The above code generates a random number from min to max+1
        
        have to add 1 to max in order to include the max number
        
        example, if you want a random number from 1 to 14 ... rnd would generate a number from 1 to 13, so we add 1 to max to make it 15 to make sure we get up to and including 14.
